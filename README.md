## Project Summary

	We are going to make a library of different functions that can be included and used by anyone. The purpose of our library will be to provide the user functions that allow them to change from one kind of data structure to another. For example we will have a function that allows a person to pass in an array and then return a tree with all the data from the array organized in a tree.

## How to Run

	Compile with g++ compiler and run in the terminal.

## Dependencies

	TODO: Include third-party libraries or APIs that may need installed to run

## System Requirements

	TODO: Figure out system requirements

## Contributors

	TODO: List people who contribute (Phase 3)

## Open Issues/Bugs

	We want to add a main menu so we can have the option to select different functions and do different conversions.
	We want to make our functions able to be used with any type of data, not just strings.
