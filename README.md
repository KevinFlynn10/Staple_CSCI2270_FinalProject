## Project Summary

	We are going to make a library of different functions that can be included and used by anyone. The purpose of our library will be to provide the user functions that allow them to change from one kind of data structure to another. For example we will have a function that allows a person to pass in an array and then return a tree with all the data from the array organized in a tree.
